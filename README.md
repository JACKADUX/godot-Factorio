## About this Project
I am not a game developer, but I am very interested in godot and the implementation of various functions in games. 

I like the game factorio very much，So I try to rebuild factorio in godot.
I hope to have a deeper understanding of using godot and improve my coding skills through this project.
Feel free to download and use the source code!
